Ant_force_sensor
================

This code allows for tracking of an ant force sensor, where ants carry a sensor consisting of acrylic disks connected by helical springs with april-tags (http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/). The experimental setup should be a static camera looking down on the ants. For calibration, the sensor can be rotated with known weights.
